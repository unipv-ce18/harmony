That's right
Loyal to
Only you
Up your sleeve
I want some (come on, take it)
Of all of you (it's yours)

Then it take'th away
I would beg
I would plead
I would shake
On a hook
Dangling

Beautiful senses are gone
Canary in a gilded cage
Singin'
Sweet, soft and low
I will poison you all
Come closer, racin' to your tongue
I got what was
Want to take what’s left
No talk will cure
What’s lost, or save what’s left

The blind can go get fucked
Lie beside the ditch
This halo 'round my neck
Has torn out every stitch
Who are you hiding? Is it safe for the deaf?
Beautiful cancer, infiltrate then forget
Yeah, I saw you coming and I heard not a thing
A mistake not to listen
When I knew where you’d been
And I got what was
I want to take what’s left
No talk will cure
What’s lost, or save what’s left

Skin and bone
Cutting boards, hanging hooks
Bloody knives, cooking books
Promising you won?t feel a thing at all
Swallow and chew, eat you alive
All of us food, that hasn't died

Simmering, pick and pluck
Tenderize, bone to dust
The sweetest grease

Fan the flames

So I take a drink, another cigarette
I can't forget that you once were mine

I guess it wasn't meant to be
Now you're gone

Or am I walking alone?
When I turned around and found that you'd gone before
The first rain could fall
It seems every single time I was bleeding
Broken promises that never came true
Well it ain't so long before the dawn
When the sun is gone so are
Well, so are you
So what's it gonna take
To get you back in bed?
Gossip, drugs, and snakes
They're just our best fair weather friends (fair weather friends)
Fair weather friends (fair weather friends)
One day when we're far away
From everything that hurts
Drink and screw is all we'll do
Every day
So what's it gonna take
To get you back in bed?
Gossip, drugs, and snakes
They're just our best fair weather friends (fair weather friends)
And though the hour's late
Don't let 'em in your head (fair weather friends)
Gonna pray for rain again and again
Fair weather friends
Fair weather friends
Fair I don't give a shit about 'em anyhow",

And only one way up
I'm burning bridges
I destroy the mirage
Oh, visions of collisions
Fuckin 'bon voyage

From here on out
I got bruises and hickies
Stitches and scars
Got my own theme music
It plays wherever I are
Fear is the hand
That pulls your strings
A useless toy
Pitiful plaything
I'm inflagranti
In every way
It's all smooth sailing

I'm gon' do the damage
That needs gettin' done
God only knows
Where love vacations
If reason is priceless
There's no reason to pay for it
It's so easy to see
And so hard to find
Make a mountain of a mole hill
If the mole hill is mine
I hypnotize you
And no one can find you
I blow my load
Over the status quo
Here we go
I'm a little bit nonchalant
But I dance
I'm risking it always
No second chance
It's gonna be smooth sailings
From here on out
I'm gon' do the damage
'Til the damage is done yeah
God only knows
So mind your behavior
Follow prescriptions
Of your lord and savior
Every temple is gold
Every hook is designed
Hell is but the temple
Of the closed mind
Closed mind
Closed mind

Prisoner on the loose
Description:
A spitting image of me
Except for a heart-shaped hole where the hope runs out
Shock me awake
Tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Prison of sleep
Deepened now
A rabbit hole never to be found
Again
Where are you hiding, my love?
Cast off like a stone
Feelings, raw and exposed when I'm out of control
Pieces were stolen from me
But dare I say, given away
Watching the water give in
As I go down the drain
I appear missing now
I go missing,
No longer exist
One day I hope
I'm someone you'd met
Shock me awake
Tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Deeper I sleep
Further down
A rabbit hole never to be found
It's only falling in love
Because you hit the ground
Dancing on wire both ends are on fire
Cut me loose
Nowhere to run, no more room to pretend
Wandering along the road in the summer night
I go missing,
No longer exist
One day I hope
I'm someone you'd met
Shock me awake
Tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Deeper I sleep
Further down
A rabbit hole never to be found
Don't cry
With my toes on the edge it's such a lovely view
Inside
I never loved anything until I loved you
Inside
I'm over the edge, what can I do?
Inside
I never loved anything until I loved you
Don't cry

Because not everything that goes around, comes back around you know
Holding on too long is just a fear of letting go
Because not everything that goes around, comes back around you know
One thing that is clear it's all down hill from here
My love in your hand cleverly disguised
All the promises of stone, crumble in the light
Most of what you see my dear
Is worth letting go
Because not everything that goes around, comes back around you know
Holding on too long is just
A fear of want to show

One in the clouds
Feet don't fail me now

Feel like a fool, yeah, like a dancing fool, yeah
Foot loose and fancy free

Stand in the gutter
And my head's in the clouds
Feet don't fail me now
I just gotta move on
Push myself to breaking point
It's all I know to do except for lie
I chase the gates and drift ad nauseam
Driven by feelings I cannot hide
To be so civilized,
One must tell civil lies
Me and my gang come to bust you loose
We move with an urgency
Between pleasure and agony, oh oh ah

It is not the end
It ain't if you fall

Who you really are

If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe
I believe I know you
Yet I don't truly know myself
I pray you won't feel as alone
As I have felt
I don't want to fail you so
I tell you the awful truth
Everyone faces darkness on their own
As I have done, so will you

It ain't if you fall

So get up and go through
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine

And behind everything happens
Every night that falls breaks

A misdiagnosis with-a the most-est

Fake apologize
Fucks in short supply

Catgut-like reflex of the tongue

Say 'man, don't even think about it'
Push the pesticide
Xana-dos and xana-don'ts
Let you mock and then copulate me
a dirty trick and it's making me sick (Urgh!)
I'm fine
Laughter is my friend
We're supreme, sublime
G-g-g-goddamn cry
Tonight
I'm gonna put up a fight
I'm gonna get a reaction that I'm right
From the day
Slap my dick in his face
I demand satisfaction
For the night
To trick them all because of which is why I'm ashamed
Petty disguises more like skins, a distinction, vice
Drink the kool-aid
And swallow the pills
Say that you don't
And you won't but you will
Busted
Your head's like a haunted house
Peepin' at your mumbo jumbo
I'm a psycho, go bump in the night
Suicide
Make my cereal so superior
